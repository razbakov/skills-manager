## Learned User Preferences

- Keep issue filenames in `docs/issues` short and numbered for daily reference: use the next numeric prefix and a 1-2 word slug (for example, `018-scope-view.md`).
- Store all issues as Markdown files under `docs/issues`; when using the `user-story` skill, always save the output there.

## Learned Workspace Facts

- Existing issue files in `docs/issues` follow a numbered naming sequence (`001-...`, `002-...`, ...), so new issues should continue that convention.
