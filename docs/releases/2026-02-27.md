# Release Notes — 2026-02-27

## Installation & Update Reliability

- **Faster and more reliable first-time setup** (PP-018) — New installs now
  fetch only runtime dependencies, which reduces stalls during `bun install`
  on user machines.
- **More predictable in-app updates** (PP-018) — App updates now use the same
  runtime-only dependency strategy, reducing update-time failures caused by
  packaging tooling.

## Internal & Platform

- **Runtime dependency boundaries clarified** (PP-018) — Components required to
  run the desktop app are now explicitly treated as runtime dependencies to
  keep install behavior consistent across setup and updates.
