## Story Point Scale (Fibonacci)

- Use these values only: 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21

## Meaning (anchor by complexity + risk, not hours)

- 1: Tiny change. Clear solution. No new state. Minimal UI. < ~½ day.
- 2: Small feature. Limited UI/state. Low risk. ~½–1 day.
- 3: Medium. Multiple UI states or a new component. Some edge cases. ~1–2 days.
- 5: Standard feature. Cross-cutting UI + state + data. Needs tests. ~2–4 days.
- 8: Large. Several acceptance criteria with tricky UX/state sync, non-trivial edge cases. ~4–7 days.
- 13: Very large. Multiple subsystems or unclear requirements; likely needs splitting. ~1–2+ weeks.
- 21: Epic. Must be split.
